## Introduction

In this section, we will provide an overview of the tutorial and explain the benefits of using Gerrit, Pipenv, and Tox together in your development workflow.
## Benefits of using Gerrit, Pipenv, and Tox together

### Gerrit

Gerrit is a powerful code review tool designed to streamline the process of code collaboration and quality control. By integrating Gerrit into your development workflow, you can benefit from the following:

1. **Efficient Code Reviews:** Gerrit provides a web-based platform for performing code reviews, making it easy for team members to collaborate and provide feedback on code changes.

2. **Controlled Code Quality:** With Gerrit, you can define custom rules and policies for code submissions, ensuring that your codebase meets the desired standards and quality benchmarks.

3. **Seamless Integration with Git:** Gerrit seamlessly integrates with Git, allowing you to leverage its features like branch management, commit history, and version control capabilities.

### Pipenv

Pipenv is a popular package management tool for Python that combines virtual environments and dependency management. When used in conjunction with Gerrit and Tox, Pipenv offers the following advantages:

1. **Isolated Development Environments:** Pipenv creates isolated virtual environments for your projects, eliminating conflicts between different projects' dependencies and ensuring reproducibility.

2. **Dependency Management Made Easy:** Pipenv simplifies dependency management by automatically generating and managing a `Pipfile` that tracks your project's dependencies. It also provides commands to install, update, and remove packages.

3. **Streamlined Workflow with Lockfiles:** Pipenv generates a `Pipfile.lock` file that locks the versions of your project's dependencies. This ensures that all team members work with the same set of dependencies, promoting consistency across environments.

### Tox

Tox is a versatile testing tool that automates running tests against different Python environments. When combined with Gerrit and Pipenv, Tox offers the following benefits:

1. **Automated Testing:** Tox simplifies the process of running tests by automating the setup and execution of test suites across different Python versions and environments. This helps identify potential issues and ensures consistent behavior across platforms.

2. **Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) Systems:** Tox integrates well with popular CI systems like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI/CD. By configuring Tox in your CI pipeline, you can ensure that your tests are automatically executed whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

3. **Parallel Testing:** Tox allows you to run tests in parallel, speeding up the testing process and providing faster feedback on the code changes.

By leveraging the combined power of Gerrit, Pipenv, and Tox, you can establish a robust development workflow that promotes code collaboration, ensures code quality, manages dependencies effectively, and automates testing.

Let's dive into the tutorial and learn how to install and configure these tools for your development environment!

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python installed on your system(search for python on wsl in our web site )
- Basic knowledge of Git version control
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces (CLI)

## Configure Gerrit

In this section, we will guide you through the process of installing Gerrit. Gerrit is a powerful code review tool that allows for efficient collaboration and code quality control.

## Setting Up Pipenv

Pipenv is a popular package management tool for Python that combines virtual environments and dependency management. Here, we'll explain how to set up Pipenv and configure it for your projects.
ready to go
> note :  you should clone the repo of the project  and then go to  your project directory

# now you need to install pipenv in the venv of the project by simply running :
```
 install --upgrade pipenv
```
# then 
```
pipenv install --dev 
```
# general flow :

1. open git bash in pycharm
2. run 
 ``` 
 wsl 
 ```
3. then you should run 

 ``` 
source activate
 ```
# then run the pipenv by just running : 
```
pipenv shell
```

## Installing and Testing with Tox

Tox is a versatile testing tool that automates running tests against different Python environments. We'll show you how to install Tox and configure it to execute your project's test suite.
tox is the main orechestrator that will define the logice of the python development packages .
example we want to check both code format with black dev package and and check code style with flake8
we can easily configure and integrate both senarios using tox
genrally tox is provided in the project that you clone for lab2301
we have differnet stages including format check-style docs(to generate html documentation of the software )
in the future we will have more stages to run locally unit test and so on ...
# Activate your Pipenv virtual environment. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:
```
pipenv shell
```
# To run Tox and execute the tests, simply run the following command twice :
```
tox 
```
>  note :  he will not work for you for the first time you need to reruning it twice by typing the same command 

# very importent if you want to push your changes in gerrit you have to follow this flow :
1. add your commit 
2. commit your code with message 
3. run this command in order to push your changes

```
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
```
## Conclusion

In the final section, we'll summarize the key points covered in this tutorial and highlight the benefits of using Gerrit, Pipenv, and Tox in your development workflow.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a well-structured development environment that promotes code review, manages dependencies, and automates testing with ease.
