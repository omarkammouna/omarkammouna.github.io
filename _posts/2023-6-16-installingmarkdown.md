Here are the steps you requested in Markdown format:

**The Steps we will take:**
1. Install Ruby (This will be the DEV Edition)
2. Install Jekyll
3. Install Bundler
4. Create our Github Repository (We do this by Cloning The Theme to our repository)
5. Clone your new Repo to your PC for Editing
6. Make some changes to our `_config.yml` file
7. Run your site locally
8. Upload to Github
9. Re-assign our branch for github-pages

**Assumptions:**
- You must already have GIT Installed.
- You must already have a text editor. (I recommend Visual Code. It's the one used in this tutorial, and it's small and FREE)

**Installing Ruby:**
1. Head over to [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org) and install the DEV version. At the time of this tutorial, it was version Ruby+Devkit 3.1.2-1 (x64) (choose the appropriate version based on your system).
2. Make sure you install EVERYTHING.
